# Summary

## Things to note:

#### - Job length

```         
- If over 24 hours, can this be split up? Can threads be increased?
  
```

#### - Many small files

```         
- To be avoided!
- Group into larger files
  
```

#### - Data

```         
- Save space by removing temp files
- Archive data as soon as reasonable
- Let us know if you are adding several TB of data
```

#### - Use /scratch1 whenever possible for temporary files

#### - Make sure you are not on the login node when you launch an application

```         
- You can check the system you are on by typing hostname
```

#### - Make sure you reserve as many processors as you need

```         
- A mismatch here can increase your runtime or wait time
```

#### - Make sure you reserve as much RAM as needed

```         
- Overestimating increases wait time, underestimating crashes
```

#### - Know which resources work the best

```         
- Sometimes, using a debug or epyc-64 is better
```
